            Benjamin Moore is still working on his level 5 wizard beard. A lover
            of all things RPG oriented, Benjamin has a drawer full of dice to
            settle disputes. Knowing he has a terrible sense of aiming, Benjamin
            prefers to take the roles of support, tanking his way to a team
            victory. A recent graduate from Wyncode Academy, Benjamin studied
            React, Javascript, HTML/CSS, and is very proficient in databases
            (his work using MongoDB helped win his team the best app award
            during pitch night). When he's not turning coffee into code, You can
            either find him live-streaming his shenanigans on{" "}
            <a href="https://twitch.tv/m00simus">his twitch channel.</a> or
            spending time with his fianc√© and his German Shepherd co-pilot
